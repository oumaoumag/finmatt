Project Title:
TBD - Secure Escrow Platform with Integrated Scheduling & Bookkeeping for Service Businesses

Let me paint you a picture of a typical day for Sarah, a salon owner in Kisumu. She's already lost two clients this morning because her booking diary showed double bookings. Her most experienced stylist is running late with a current client, making the next customer angry in the waiting area. Meanwhile, she's trying to sort through a pile of hastily written receipts to figure out last month's earnings for her tax filing.
This is the reality for thousands of service businesses: a chaotic mix of scheduling nightmares, payment headaches, and bookkeeping confusion. Time that could be spent growing their business is wasted juggling paper calendars, manually tracking appointments, and sorting through scattered financial records.
Here's how One4All transforms this:
When a client books through our platform, the service is automatically scheduled with real-time availability checks - no more double bookings. The system sends automated reminders to both clients and service providers, drastically reducing no-shows and late arrivals. Service providers can see their entire day at a glance and manage their time effectively.
But here's where it gets really powerful: Every scheduled service automatically creates a financial record. When payment is made into escrow, it's instantly logged. When the service is completed and payment released, it's categorized and recorded. At any moment, a business owner can pull up:
Daily, weekly, or monthly earnings
Service-specific performance metrics
Tax-ready financial statements
Employee performance records
Popular service times and peak periods
Imagine going from hours of manual bookkeeping to having all your financial records automatically organized and ready for tax season. Business owners can finally understand their cash flow patterns, make data-driven decisions about pricing and staffing, and focus on what they do best - providing great service.
This isn't just about securing payments - it's about giving small business owners back their time and peace of mind while providing them with insights they've never had access to before. We're turning scheduling headaches and bookkeeping nightmares into opportunities for growth and better business management
